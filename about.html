                <p>Our cultural journey began in 2021 with the inception of Poetica, a cultural festival that beckoned students from across the city to showcase their poetic prowess in a riveting poetry recitation competition.</p>
                <p>Building upon the success of Poetica, we expanded our horizons the following year with Carnivalesque, a grand celebration inspired by Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the carnivalesque. This festival, rooted in Bakhtin's notion of suspending societal norms, attracted over 700 students in its inaugural year, with 8 captivating events. Carnivalesque 2.0 continued this legacy, drawing in 500+ students, and now, in its third iteration, Carnivalesque 3.0, we are proud to introduce a new segment dedicated to dance, delving into our cultural roots to enrich the authenticity of literature.</p>
                <p>In addition to our flagship Carnivalesque, we have embarked on a global journey with an online platform inviting literature enthusiasts from schools and colleges worldwide to partake in our festivities. Furthermore, in the odd semester, we host Lingua Fiesta, a Language festival aimed at providing students with a myriad of opportunities to engage with literature and language through events such as theatre, drawmics, concloset, spell bee, and more.</p>
                <p>At AIESR, we believe in fostering a culture of inclusivity and opportunity, providing a fair chance for all students to hone their talents, build confidence, and nurture a passion for learning. Our competitions serve as a broader arena for self-growth and development, empowering students to embrace their creativity and embark on a journey of personal and academic excellence. Join us in celebrating the richness of language and literature, where every student's voice finds resonance and every talent finds its stage.</p>
