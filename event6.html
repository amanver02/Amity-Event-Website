    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>The Amity Institute of English Studies and Research invites you to an exceptional treasure hunt that lures around the corners of fun amalgamated in literature. Unravel the enchanting power that literature holds; you'll get to experience the amazing things that literature can do in this upgraded version Carnivalesque 3.0 #Pirates of LitsVilla. "I won't call it a treasure hunt, but it's like an old Western movie where you're onto one thing and it turns into another" ~Aaron Brookner. As you set out on your quest, remember, there are clues to guide you, each one pointing you in the direction of the next. And as you follow these clues, a picture will begin to form in your mind, revealing the path to the ultimate prize. But beware, for this is no ordinary treasure hunt, it will require all your skills and craft to decipher the hidden messages and uncover the mystery. In the end, it's not about the treasure itself, but the thrill of the chase. So, gear up and get ready to test your wits, because the hunt is on and time is running out. Will you be the one to find the treasure, or will you be the one hunted!</p>
